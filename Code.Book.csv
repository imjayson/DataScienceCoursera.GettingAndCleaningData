Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project,,,,,,Data has been reorganized from individual observations with ID variables of Subject and Activity with the rest as measurement variables.,,,Observations are grouped by the abovementioned ID variables and measurement variables sumarized as averages of all observations.,,,These averages are that of their normalized source data.,,,,,,"Below is the description of each column of the output data, along with the source observation data reference, if applicable.",,,,,,Column No.,Column Name,Description,Source
